            <p>
                <img src="/img/andrea-thumb.png" class="thumb" alt="Andrea"/>
                Born in Berkeley and raised in Orinda, Andrea fondly remembers much of her
                childhood being spent around Bay Area pools, basketball courts, and with her
                family. To this day, her swim record at the Moraga Country Club still stands from
                when she was 7 years old! A planner to her very core, Andrea enjoys travel and has
                lived in and visited many corners of the world. When Andrea isn't coordinating her
                next event at work, you can probably find her tearing up the dance floor or talking
                about getting a kitten.

                <img src="/img/matt-thumb.png" class="thumb" alt="Matt"/>
                Imported from the great white north, Matt grew up in Toronto, studied engineering
                at the University of Waterloo, and promptly moved to the Bay Area to pursue his
                technology career. Matt also grew up playing basketball, and he'll partake in any
                activity that gets him running around. Thanks to Andrea's influence, he most
                recently has caught the triathlon bug. Matt enjoys soaking in Californian culture
                with a strong IPA and some hip hop. One day, he hopes to have a dog (but not before
                Andrea gets her cat).

            <h2>HOW WE MET</h2>
            <p>The happy couple first met on Andrea's birthday in the summer of 2012 at the bar
            Nola in downtown Palo Alto. Andrea was celebrating with a group of friends and Matt
            was with a co-worker, grabbing a drink after work.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_SI2EDM6Lo">Break Your Heart by Taio Cruz ft Ludacris</a>
            was playing and Andrea was singing along (to the Luda part, of course). Matt's opener
            was to comment on how much Andrea must really like the song. Andrea wasn't particularly
            amused, but Matt persisted, and asked to participate in the birthday festivities
            presenting her with some Nola beads as a birthday gift. After some chatting and
            dancing, Andrea agreed to give Matt her number.</p>
            <p>For their first date Andrea and Matt went to La Strada, an Italian restaurant in
            Palo Alto. The week following the date they spent almost every day together, and
            they've never looked back.</p>

            <h2>OUR ENGAGEMENT</h2>
            <p>It was the summer of 2015, and Andrea and Matt had just returned from a trip to
            Austria and Ireland. Andrea's birthday was fast approaching, and Matt informed her that
            this year he had a special romantic weekend planned. Andrea was very suspicious.
            Something was up.</p>
            <p>On the weekend of Andrea's birthday, they travelled to Santa Cruz, where Matt
            insisted that they take a walk on the beach to check out the sea lions and grab lunch.
            At the very end of the pier, Andrea was surprised by a group of her friends and family
            who delivered a huge "Happy Birthday!" Matt then took Andrea's hand and told her there
            was a second piece to the surprise. Matt proposed, and Andrea said yes.</p>
            <p>The group celebrated with a champagne toast at the Dream Inn lounge, some beach
            volleyball, and a night of dancing.</p>

            <p>The Lafayette Park Hotel &amp; Spa is a staple of the Lamorinda area. Whenever
            Andrea's extended family members would visit Orinda, they would stay at this hotel. It
            was also the site of her basketball and swimming awards dinners growing up. It is
            filled with garden courtyards, a fountain pool area, and fabulous food to provide an
            East Bay retreat.</p>
